# Data Analysis and Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my data analysis and data science repository, where I showcase a collection of projects that demonstrate the skills I've acquired over the past few months. This repository is a reflection of my passion for data-driven insights, data manipulation, and effective data visualization. Whether you're a fellow data enthusiast or just curious, I hope you find my work engaging and insightful.

## Repository Structure

Inside this repository, you'll find three distinct folders, each housing a variety of projects that highlight specific skill sets:

### 1. Python Data Manipulation and Cleaning
In this folder, you'll discover projects that leverage Python for data manipulation and cleaning. Python is a versatile tool for tasks such as data wrangling, cleansing, and transformation. These projects showcase my proficiency in using Python libraries to work with diverse datasets, preparing them for analysis and modeling.

### 2. SQL Data Manipulation and SQL Server Designs
The SQL folder contains projects that demonstrate my SQL skills for data manipulation, database design, and query optimization. You'll find examples of database schema design, complex SQL queries, and data extraction from relational databases. SQL is a fundamental tool for managing and extracting valuable insights from structured data.

### 3. Power BI for Data Visualization
In this folder, I explore the power of Power BI, a robust data visualization tool. These projects showcase how I transform raw data into interactive and informative visualizations. Power BI enables me to create compelling dashboards and reports, making data-driven decision-making accessible to a broader audience.
